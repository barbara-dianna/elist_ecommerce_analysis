# Portfolio Project - Elist Sales Analysis

Elist is a sample e-commerce company that sells popular electronics to customers around the world. In this portfolio project, I analyzed a sample dataset to investigate trends and growth rates in revenue, average order value, and product popularity to surface insights on overall company performance. I also investigated the effectiveness of their recently launched loyalty program to give recommendations on the continuation of the program.

I used Pivot Tables, conditional formatting, aggregation functions, VLOOKUP functions, and statistical analysis to clean, analyze, and summarize the insights below, to be delivered to the finance and product team.

# Summary of Insights

**Yearly Trends:** From 2019 to 2022, the average annual sales reached 23K orders with a yearly revenue of $6 million and an average order value of $253. Notably, 2021 had the highest number of sales (30,733), while 2020 exhibited the highest average order value ($300).

**Seasonality:** March and October have the highest growth rates every year. The exception to this is October 2022, which had the lowest growth rate at -34%. The highest growth rate was in March 2020, at +50%.

**Products:** Apple Airpods Headphones consistently had the highest amount of orders across all regions but the 27in 4K gaming monitor has had the highest total sales. The Bose Soundsport Headphones make up less than 1% of sales every year. Next steps are to obtain costs data and calculate profit to determine if the product should be kept in stock.

**Loyalty Program:** Sales from the loyalty program surpassed the non-loyalty program sales in late 2020. Since the beginning of 2021, sales in both categories began to decline at the same rate but loyalty program sales remain the highest of the two.
